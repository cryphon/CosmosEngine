# 🌌 cosmosEngine

**cosmosEngine** is a 3D rendering engine built from scratch using OpenGL. The goal is to serve as a flexible sandbox for learning and experimenting with real-time graphics, simulation, and interactive visual tools — from basic geometry to complex physical systems.
Its named this way cuz i like space :)

## 🚀 Idea

cosmosEngine is designed to go from a minimal 3D engine into a modular simulation and visualization framework. it aims to support:

- Real-time graphics and UI
- Physics simulation
- Interactive camera control
- Procedural scenes
- Educational visualization tools (e.g., planetary systems, field visualizations)

as a start...

## 🌠 Current Capabilities

- 🎮 Real-time object rendering with camera control
- 🧱 Basic geometry
- 🖱️ Interactive user interfaace via ImGui
- 📐 Dynamic camera positioning and scaling
- 🧩 Modular components (Shader, VAO/VBO/EBO, Texture system)
