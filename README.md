# 🌌 cosmosEngine

**cosmosEngine** is a lightweight 3D rendering engine built from scratch using OpenGL — designed as a modular, simulation-ready sandbox for learning real-time graphics, shader programming, and procedural geometry.

Named this way because I like space 🚀

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project serves as a personal playground to explore:

- Real-time rendering pipelines
- Physically based shading and cubemaps
- Interactive scene design and UI tools
- Procedural mesh generation
- Custom 3D engine architecture

Whether for reflective objects, dynamic environments, or eventually full-on simulations — this engine is built to be flexible, clean, and fun to experiment with.

## 🌠 Features

- 🎮 Real-time object rendering with free-fly camera
- 🧱 Support for `.obj` meshes and procedural UV spheres
- 🌌 Skybox & cubemap environment reflections
- 🖼️ Reflective surface shaders (GLSL)
- 📐 Scene-based architecture (`MainScene`, `SecondScene`, etc.)
- 🧰 Modular OpenGL wrappers (`Shader`, `Mesh`, `Material`, `Renderer`)
- 🎛️ UI tools powered by ImGui
- 📦 Texture & shader management system

---

## 📚 Goals

- 🔬 Build educational visualizations (e.g. orbit simulation, ray tracing)
- 🧪 Test procedural generation (meshes, materials, entire scenes)
- 🧩 Design for modularity — reusable renderer, materials, scenes
- ⚙️ Eventually support real-time physics and raytracing extensions

---

## 💻 Built With

- OpenGL (core profile)
- C++17
- ImGui
- stb_image
- tinyobjloader

## 🔭 Coming Soon

- [ ] Physically based materials (roughness, metallic)
- [ ] Real-time shadows
- [ ] Scene editor tools
- [ ] glTF support
- [ ] Interactive visualizations (gravity, field lines)
